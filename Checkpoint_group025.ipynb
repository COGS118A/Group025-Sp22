    "For our ethical review, we consulted the ‘’Data Science Ethics Checklist’’ by deon (https://deon.drivendata.org/), which contains check items for every data-related project. When people make a review on Steam, they get the option to choose whether it is public, only for their friends, or private.\n",
    "Nevertheless, we have chosen to use an anonymous data set for privacy reasons and avoid creating a potential bias by including personal information like gender for instance. Besides that, we also avoid the risk of unintended harm by choosing the anonymous data, where we avoid online abuse or physical harm being conducted upon the participants since their private information will be kept private in every way. \n",
    "Also, since some reviews are already private, this equalizes all the reviews together and Steam has provided this data. Their own website does have a privacy policy about for their users (https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/) so people must approve that. Despite the anonymity, we will also not use the data for any other purposes than our project. We have chosen a huge dataset which hopefully minimizes our potential bias. \n",
    "We are very aware of potential risks like p-hacking and wrongly sampling sizing and will pay attention to those. Any very odd outliers will be investigated and taken seriously. We know the source of our data and will share the dataset in our proposal for total transparency."

Also, we try to take everyones preferences considering topics for instance in consideration and so far this worked us very smoothly.
