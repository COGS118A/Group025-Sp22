    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "\n",
    "Individuals leave reviews on the popular online gaming storefront Steam every day. People often go into great detail reviewing their favorite or least favorite games, making this a ripe field for sentiment analysis. Our goal is to train a model to detect the sentiment of a Steam user's review and be able to relay if this person enjoyed the game or not, and to what extent. We will be training a model with a large labelled dataset of reviews. Success will be measured by how accurately the model is able to detect whether a review is positive or negative, and if the person recommended the game or not."

    "Steam is an online gaming platform which describes itself as \"the ultimate destination for playing, discussing, and creating games\" (https://store.steampowered.com/about/). According to Statista, there are approximately 120 million people that are active montly on Steam in the year 2020 which demonstrates its wide reach of audience. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/308330/number-stream-users/) As of this moment, there are about 18 million users online and 4 million users playing games on Steam. (https://store.steampowered.com/about/) These are all crazy numbers which just shows how much gaming is a part of people's lives. So how does one decide which game to dedicate their lives to or just to play for fun? This is where data and analytics come to play as users generate data and rate how each game feels for them personally. This makes up the rating of each game on Steam where there will be a positive or negative rating displayed for each game where for example Game X has a 80% positive rating showing that 80 percent of the users who rated the game enjoyed playing the game. This data which is user generated allows other players or people of interest to make their pre-emptive decisions of a game and whether they should play it or not. A user or person of interest would rather play a game with a 80 percent positive rating to a 50 percent positive rating based on conventional logic. The purpose of our study and research is to create a machine learning algorithm which deals with user ratings and decide whether it is positive or negative using sentiment analysis. This will help predict whether the user has upvoted or downvoted the game. In other words, determing the game's ratings. Why is this useful one may ask? Gaining a better understanding of user ratings and whether a user will decide to upvote or downvote a game can allow game creators and platforms to gauge whether to recommend the right games to users since the goal of the industry is to keep players interested in using the platform and the wider amount of games they become addicted to. A lot of articles online highlight the importance of the first 10 reviews since it allows it to sit on the shelve of the gaming platform (Steam) or else it stays hidden so you can see how important ratings are to games. (https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/01/25/why-your-first-10-reviews-are-the-most-important/) To add to it, the better the ratings of a game, the higher the likelihood of being featured more heavily in the front pages of the Steam so it's useful for both the companies and the platform itself to understand how well-rated a game is since it is a key indicator of their performance.\n",
