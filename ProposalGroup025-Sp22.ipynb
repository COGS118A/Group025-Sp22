    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",

    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every day, individuals leave reviews on the popular online gaming storefront Steam. People often go into great detail reviewing their favorite or least favorite games, making this a ripe field for sentiment analysis. Our goal is to train a model to detect the sentiment of a Steam user's review and be able to relay if this person enjoyed the game or not, and to what extent. We will be training a model with a large labelled dataset of reviews. Success will be measured by how accurately the model is able to detect whether a review is positive or negative, and if the person recommended the game or not."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Steam is a highly-used online marketplace for P.C. videogames. The popularity of the platform has developed into a social feature by housing the P.C. gaming community and connecting friends through muutually-played games. An important feature of Steam, both as a marketplace and a social sphere, is the ability to write, read, and rate reviews for games. \n",
    "\n",
    "The plethora of review on Steam provides both an interesting and abundant source of text with potential to drive useful sentiment analysis models. In their paper, \"Steam Review Dataset - new, large scale sentiment dataset,\" Sobkowicz and Stokowiec introduce a dataset which they claim could be a powerful source of consumer data for sentiment analysis <a name=\"Sobkowicz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Sobkowicz). Utlizing these reviews has relevant and important implications. Since these reviews act as consumer data, conclusions drawn from these reviews inform both gamers and game developers about successful and worthwile games. Additionally, the function of reviewing is a very powerful feature, providing gamers with a voice that directly impacts which games sell and which games flop <a name=\"Sobkowicz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Sobkowicz). It would be highly valuable for both development of future games and for satisfaction of gamers to tailor the review system to be effective and informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it stands, reviews consist of both written commentary and a \"Yes\" (thumbs-up) or \"No\" (thumbs-down). The Yes and No ratings for each game are averaged to create two summative ratings which appear underneath the synopsis of the game when a user views the game's page. \"Recent Reviews\" averages the number of positive and negative recent reviews. \"All\" averages the number of all positive and negative reviews. The summative ratings are labeled on a scale of: overwhelmingly negative, very negative, negative, mostly negative, mixed, mostly positive, positive, very positive, overwhelmingly positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this feedback is already incredibly helpful to gamers and game developers, it is questionable whether the data is entirely accurate. As they stand, the summative ratings are binary, only based on \"Yes\" or \"No.\" There is no way to account for partially liking or disliking a game. Forcing users to choose between Yes or No may skew the ratings incorrectly, since there is no middle ground. Therefore, it would be useful to also summatively analyze the written data in order to develop a a more well-rounded summary of a game's reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "We propose the most meaningful way to analyze and summarize a game's written reviews would be to perform a sentiment analysis to predict the rating of a game based on the written reviews."
